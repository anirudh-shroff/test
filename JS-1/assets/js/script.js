// console.log(123);

// window - entire browser area
// document is entire white area where html is displayed (webpages)

// window.alert("123");
// it shows alert on the while loading the page is loading

// document.write("This id writen using js");

// prompt("do you want to continue");
// prompt assk for user input before loading the page, conditions can be added to code to form a decision

//what is a variable? - it is a container to store data and it can be accessed later.
//three types of variables in js:

// var - ES5
// let - ES6
// const - ES6

// in js, any datatype can be added to a variable, datatype need not be declared in front of variable like done in c++

// Datatypes:

// let a = 10;          integer
// let a = b;           string
// let a = 3.14;        float
// let a = null;
// let a = Infinity;    
// let a = undefined;
// let a = true;        boolean value

// and some miscelaneous datatypes* for later reference

// let a = "hello";
// console.log(a);

// undefined - the default value of a  variable, which later changes when that variable is assigned a value

// const is used when you don't want to value of variable to change
// 1.   let cannot be reinitialized, it is blockscoped. not exposed in window object, so mostly used instead of var
// 2.   const cannot be reinitialized, it is blockscoped as well, aslo it is a contant value, it is also  not exposed but has limited use cases.
// 3.   var can be reinitialized. it is also exposed in window object through which sensitive data can be accessed. so it should be used in a function but not in global scope
